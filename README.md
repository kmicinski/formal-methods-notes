# Formal Methods for Computer Security
### CIS 700, Syracuse U, Fall 2020
### Instructor: Kris Micinski

This is a loose collection of course notes for my course CIS700, a
special topics course at the intersection of formal methods and
computer security. The course is focused on reading papers, and these
notes are meant to be read alongside readings and books assigned
throughout the course. The purpose of the notes is to give some
intuition and context for things I think are particularly relevant to
computer scientists and programmers as they read these papers.

- `fopl.md` -- First-Order Predicate Logic (mostly model theory basics) for computer science.
